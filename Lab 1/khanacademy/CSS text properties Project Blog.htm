        <h4>PAST YEAR REFLECTIONS: ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES</h4>
        <p>Reflect on the past year. It’s been an awkward one, but think about where you are at right now. What have you achieved and what didn’t go according to plan? </p>
        
        <h4>NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS</h4>
        <p>Once you are done reflecting on life, think about what you would like to achieve in the new year. Set your resolutions, but be realistic and precise!</p>

        <h4>DIGITAL SCAVENGER HUNT</h4>
        <p>This one’s my favorite! Unleash your imagination and create a digital scavenger hunt! Design a theme and Easter eggs that you can hide in your already existing blog articles. Reward the first 3 readers that will find the Easter eggs and complete the digital scavenger hunt! </p>
        
        <h4>HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS?</h4>
        <p>It’s great to post often and to engage with your readers, but sometimes you just need to take a break. It is the holiday season, after all! Share how you are going to spend December and January.!</p>
